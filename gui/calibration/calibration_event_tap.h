// gui/calibration/calibration_event_tap.h — rolling CD-event buffer for the
// Phase 4 calibration wizard.
//
// Subscribes to CameraController::cd_events_ready and keeps recent batches. The
// wizard calls drain_last_window() when the user presses Space to grab the most
// recent window_us of events (polarity-agnostic capture) and render a full-
// resolution binary frame for cv::findCirclesGrid.
//
// The connection uses Qt::DirectConnection so on_events_ready() runs on the
// SDK streaming thread (where the signal is emitted), NOT the GUI thread.
// A queued connection would post every batch to the GUI thread's event queue,
// and when findCirclesGrid blocks the worker thread the queue grows without
// bound — each batch is a heap-allocated shared_ptr<vector<EventCD>> — and the
// process is OOM-killed. With a direct connection, batches go straight into
// the ring (under mutex_) and never enter the event queue. on_events_ready() is
// thread-safe (mutex only, no GUI) and the destructor disconnects + drains to
// prevent use-after-free.
//
// Performance design (Phase 4 perf pass, referencing FocusAssistant):
// The camera controller already deep-copies each batch into a
// shared_ptr<vector<EventCD>> before emitting. The tap used to copy every
// event AGAIN into a flat vector — a second per-event copy on the SDK thread
// that doubled the memory-allocation overhead of cd_broadcast and starved the
// main display pipeline at high event rates. The tap now stores the shared_ptr
// directly (refcount increment only — no per-event copy) in a deque of batches.
// drain_last_window() walks the batches and collects the in-window events on
// the GUI thread, which runs only once per Space press. This makes the SDK-
// thread cost of cd_broadcast O(1) per batch instead of O(N) per batch.
//
// Phase 4 bug-absorption: attach() disconnects any prior connection before
// connecting, so repeated set_camera() calls do not stack duplicate
// connections (the main caee2c0 tap connected unconditionally on every call).
